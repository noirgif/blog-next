This is my first post.

I am trying to work on several things to hone my skills, they are:

1. Change the front page layout.
2. Add a field 'lang' in each blog post, to indicate the language the blog post is in. So that the browser can render using the right font.
3. Change the theme.
4. Add fade in/out animation when switching between pages.

The last two are more of a CSS thing, so I will leave them for later.
