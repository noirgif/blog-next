## TL;DR

If the build fails, try updating Next.js.

## Error, error never changes

After finishing the giving name post, I tried to build and deploy the [blog](https://github.com/noirgif/blog-next/commit/154df1a65b85327028a02abe82f9bf0229a4788e), but I got an error.

When running `pnpm run build` I got the following message:

```zsh

```

Running the first command, `pnpm cross-env INIT_CWD=$PWD next build`, I got the same error. So the problem is not in the postbuild script.

Running `next dev` is also fine (both the post page and the sitemap). So the problem is not in the code.

Just in case, using yarn does not change the problem (it happens in different places, and I haven't found out the rule for that).

## Where to look into

`.next/server/app/sitemap.xml/route.js` as well as the `.next/server/chunks/414.js` contains minified code, so we need to find out how they are generated.

I went to [their site](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) and found out that they use they recently implemented a new compiler, called SWC compiler, that is blazing fast, because it is written in Rust. And that comes with a minifier.

Didn't I said the problems occur in minified code? So let's try turning off the SWC minifier.

```diff
diff --git a/next.config.js b/next.config.js
index 7a2bd09..be1621a 100644

     pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
     eslint: {
```

It says one of my post is missing a `images` field and it became undefined. A minor problem. So I went to add that. Since lacking images will be the everlasting problem of this blog, I decided to add a empty default value to that field.

Since I fixed an error in the post, I went back to use the SWC minifier again to see if anything changes. If it does, then it might be some error handling problem. Turns out it is not.

While working with Rust is not something I expected in the begining, here we go.

But before we dive in, I want to try updating Next.js to 13.3.5, the latest version.

And...

It worked. So there is no more exploring.

By the way, there are still many open issues about their minifier, guess I am lucky to get it fixed by updating.
