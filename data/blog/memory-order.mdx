I tried to write about memory order once. But I could not made it until the end. I think the cause is that the blog post has been delayed for months. With a protracted writing period, the motivation diminished. This time I will come out with a whole introduction, from how C++ standard says down to how to implement them in CPUs.

## C++ Memory Order

Let us begin with a multi-threaded counter.

```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

// variable to stop the loop
bool done = false;

// when not ready (nothing on the product line), put a product
void producer(int& product, bool& ready) {
    int some_product = 0;
    while (!done) {
        if (!ready) {
            product = some_product;
            ready = true;
        }
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(100ms);
        std::cout << "Produced " << some_product << std::endl;
        some_product++;
    }
}

// when ready, read from the `product` and print it
void consumer(int& product, bool& ready) {
    int consumed_product = 0;
    while (!done) {
        if (ready) {
            consumed_product = product;
            ready = false;
            std::cout << "Consumed " << consumed_product << std::endl;
        }
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(100ms);
    }
}

int main() {
    int product = 0;
    bool ready = false;
    auto producer_thread = std::thread([&]() { producer(product, ready); });
    auto consumer_thread = std::thread([&]() { consumer(product, ready); });

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(3s);
    done = true;

    producer_thread.join();
    consumer_thread.join();
    return 0;
}
```

We want variables that are read and written concurrently to be atomic, in this case, `ready` and `product`. Here is the question: what are the minimal order constraints we need to obey?

I think there are two constraints:

1. If `ready` is true, the `product` we read must be the `some_product` that is set right before.

In a diagram:

2. We cannot set `ready` to false before reading from `product`, otherwise the producer might have the chance to overwrite the `product` before we read from it:

To summarize, we cannot swap the order between 'ready = some bool' and the code **before** it, nor can we swap the order between 'read ready' and the code **after** it.

And that is the spirit of `release` and `acquire`. In a world where compilers can rearrange code, and the CPU can do multithreading and pipelining, we have to ask for it by writing them in C/C++ code.

Another example would be a **mutex**. We can only make accesses in the critical section -- after the lock is `acquire`d and before it is `release`d.
